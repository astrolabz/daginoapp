## Setup Instructions

### For SendGrid

2. **Generate API Key**

   - Copy the API key (starts with "SG.")

3. **Configure in Restaurant Website**
   - Access admin panel (owner login required)
   - Go to Email Configuration

   - Enter your API key
   - Set sender email and name

### For AWS SES

   - Navigate to SES service
   - Verify your sender email address

2. **Create IAM User**

## Security Considerations

### Email Tokens
- Each reservation confirmation email contains a unique, time-limited token
- Tokens expire after 24 hours for security
- Tokens are cryptographically secure and unpredictable

### API Key Storage
- API keys are stored securely in browser localStorage
- Keys are not exposed in client-side code
- Production deployments should use environment variables

### Email Content
- No sensitive customer information in email subjects
- All templates are reviewed for security and privacy
- Confirmation links use HTTPS only

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Email Delivery Status
The admin panel provides:
- Real-time test email functionality
- Last test result and timestamp
- Configuration validation
- Error messages and resolution guidance

### Common Issues

1. **Emails not being sent**
   - Check API key validity
   - Verify sender email is configured in provider
   - Check provider account status and limits

2. **Emails going to spam**
   - Ensure sender domain is verified
   - Configure SPF/DKIM records
   - Use professional sender name and email

3. **Template formatting issues**
   - Test emails on different email clients
   - Use template preview in admin panel
   - Verify HTML template validity

## Technical Implementation

### Integration Points

### Template Variables
All email templates support these variables:

- `{{guests}}` - Number of guests
- `{{specialRequests}}` - Customer's special requests
- `{{confirmationUrl}}` - Confirmation link

## Best Practices

### For Restaurant Owners
1. **Test Regularly**: Use the test email function monthly
2. **Monitor Deliverability**: Check spam folders and customer feedback
3. **Keep Information Updated**: Ensure contact details in templates are current
4. **Backup Provider**: Consider having a secondary email provider configured

### For Developers
1. **Error Handling**: Always handle email failures gracefully
2. **Rate Limiting**: Respect provider rate limits
3. **Template Updates**: Test all template changes thoroughly
4. **Security**: Regularly rotate API keys and review access
